//In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you
// don't have to remember the values of the bands. The program will take
// color names as input and output a two digit number, even if the input
// is more than two colors!
//
//The band colors are encoded as follows:
//
//Black: 0
//Brown: 1
//Red: 2
//Orange: 3
//Yellow: 4
//Green: 5
//Blue: 6
//Violet: 7
//Grey: 8
//White: 9
//From the example above: brown-green should return 15 brown-green-violet
// should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.
